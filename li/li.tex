\begin{abstract}
This internship at the Monmouth County Department of Engineering provided valuable insight into project management and client-side processes within the public sector. Responsibilities encompassed handling submittals, Requests for Professional Qualifications (RFPQ), and Requests for Proposals (RFP), offering a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows. Analysis of past projects facilitated the development of practical knowledge and technical skills in engineering practices. Current contributions include reviewing the Hall of Records facade project and focusing on researching Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) and other materials critical to the redesign. This experience highlights the integration of design, material selection, and project coordination in public infrastructure projects.
