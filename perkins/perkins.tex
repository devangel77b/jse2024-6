\begin{abstract}
T\&M Associates is a National Engineering firm headquartered in Middletown, New Jersey that specializes in many different fields of engineering. Throughout the past semester, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) Engineers at T\&M, working on CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Systems. These drawings play a crucial role in the construction process, guiding contractors through the installation of the HVAC systems of a building.
