\begin{abstract}
Modern organizations need efficient IT and streamlined release cycles to scale and stay agile. During my internship at Commvault I helped improve server management and software release processes through automation. I wrote and deployed Python and SQL scripts to address key inefficiencies like monitoring unauthorized access, automated release notifications and log analysis. These automation tools reduced troubleshooting time and human error and improved system reliability and communication between teams. I used industry standard libraries and best practices to ensure the tools were robust and scalable and tested and refined each script before deployment. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of DevOps and showed me the power of automation in IT workflows. This experience underscored the power of automation in transforming IT workflows, showcasing the practical application of DevOps principles in a professional setting.
